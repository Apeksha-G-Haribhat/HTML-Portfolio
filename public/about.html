<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I’m Apeksha, a curious learner and aspiring web developer who loves creating simple, user-friendly designs. I enjoy exploring how technology and creativity come together to build meaningful digital experiences. Learning HTML, CSS, and design has helped me express ideas visually and turn concepts into real web pages.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy discovering new tools, improving my skills, and working on small projects that help me grow. I believe learning by doing is the best way to improve, and I’m excited to keep building and exploring more in the world of web development.</p>
